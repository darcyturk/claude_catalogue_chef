Intelligent PDF Extraction with Adaptive Learning: A Parabola.io-Inspired Interactive Environment
1. Core Architectural Philosophy: The "Controller" and Modular "Blocks"
The system will be designed around a central "controller" that orchestrates a series of modular Python scripts, each acting as a specialized "block" in a data pipeline, similar to Parabola.io's visual workflow. The user will interact primarily with this controller, which will guide them through the process, present intermediate results, and solicit feedback.
* controller.sh (The Orchestrator/Base Brain): This bash script will serve as the primary entry point and workflow manager. It will define the high-level operational flow, call Python scripts sequentially, implement conditional logic based on user input, and manage the overall state. It will act as the "faucet" system, allowing the user to control the flow and direction.
* Python Modules (The "Blocks"): Each major function (PDF parsing, layout analysis, interactive feedback, web scraping, barcode detection, JSON generation, learning updates) will reside in its own Python script. This modularity enhances reusability, testability, and allows for clear separation of concerns.
* Persistent State Management: A state.json file will track the progress, user preferences, and learned parameters across sessions, enabling users to pause and resume the process seamlessly.
* Temporary Data Exchange: Intermediate data between Python scripts will be passed via temporary files (e.g., JSON, CSV, image files) or standard output/input, managed by the controller.sh.
2. Detailed Plan for Interactive & Adaptive Extraction
2.1. setup_environment.sh (Initial Setup & Dependencies)
* Purpose: Automate the installation of all necessary libraries and tools.
* Parabola.io Inspiration: A smooth onboarding experience.
* Implementation:
    * Bash script to check for Python 3, pip, and git.
    * Install core Python libraries: PyMuPDF, Pillow, Playwright, transformers (for LayoutLM), datasets, opencv-python, pyzbar, fuzzywuzzy, jsondiff or recursive-diff.
    * Install Playwright browser binaries (playwright install).
    * Provide clear instructions for installing Tesseract-OCR, as it's an external dependency for PyMuPDF's OCR capabilities.
    * Create necessary project directories (e.g., data/raw_pdf, data/processed_pages, data/images/products, data/images/brands, data/learning_data, output).
2.2. pdf_parser.py (The "PDF Input" Block)
* Purpose: Extract raw textual content (words with bounding boxes), images, and page metadata from the PDF.
* Parabola.io Inspiration: The initial "Load Data" block, showing what raw information is available.
* Implementation:
    * Use PyMuPDF for high-performance extraction of text, images, and their precise bounding boxes.
    * Extract page.get_text("words") to get token-level text and bounding boxes, crucial for LayoutLM.
    * Extract all embedded images using page.get_images() and doc.extract_image(xref), saving them to a temporary directory. Store metadata like ext, width, height, colorspace, bbox.
    * For each page, generate a high-resolution image representation using page.get_pixmap() for visual feedback and LayoutLM input. 1
    * Output a structured JSON file per page (e.g., data/processed_pages/page_X.json) containing:
        * page_number
        * page_dimensions (width, height)
        * text_tokens: list of {"text": "word", "bbox": [x0, y0, x1, y1], "font_size":..., "is_bold":...}
        * images: list of {"id": "img_id", "bbox": [x0, y0, x1, y1], "path": "local_path", "metadata": {...}}
    * Intelligent OCR Integration: Implement logic to detect if a page is primarily image-based or has sparse text (e.g., by checking page.get_text() output). If so, automatically trigger PyMuPDF's integrated Tesseract-OCR for that page and merge the OCR'd text with its bounding boxes into the text_tokens list.
2.3. layout_analyzer.py (The "Intelligent Layout & Entity Recognition" Block)
* Purpose: Use LayoutLM to understand the document structure, identify columns, and semantically tag product-related entities.
* Parabola.io Inspiration: The "AI Processing" block, showing its inferences.
* Implementation:
    * LayoutLM Input Preparation:
        * Load page images and text_tokens (words and bboxes) from pdf_parser.py output.
        * Normalize bounding boxes to the 0-1000 scale required by LayoutLM. 6
        * Prepare input for LayoutLM (tokens, normalized bboxes, image pixels) using LayoutLMv3Processor.from_pretrained().
    * Semantic Entity Recognition (NER):
        * Load a pre-trained LayoutLM model (e.g., microsoft/layoutlmv3-base) fine-tuned for document understanding.
        * Perform inference to get token-level BIO tags for custom entities: SKU, PRODUCT_NAME, PRICE, VARIATION, MIN_ORDER_QTY, BARCODE_TEXT, RELATED_PRODUCT, BRAND_NAME.
    * Intelligent Grouping & Structuring:
        * Post-processing NER Output: Group consecutive B- and I- tagged tokens into complete entities (e.g., "B-PRODUCT_NAME Apple I-PRODUCT_NAME iPhone" becomes "Apple iPhone"). 12
        * Dynamic Column Detection & Product Block Identification: Implement heuristics based on spatial proximity (x, y coordinates), font properties (size, bolding), and inferred column boundaries to group related entities (product name, SKU, price, image) into distinct "product blocks." This will adapt to multi-column layouts.
        * Output a preliminary_structured_data.json containing inferred product objects per page, with all identified attributes and their bounding boxes.
2.4. interactive_feedback.py (The "User Feedback & Correction" Block)
* Purpose: Provide a rich, interactive command-line interface for user review and correction, similar to Parabola.io's data manipulation.
* Parabola.io Inspiration: The core interactive canvas where users see, understand, and manipulate data.
* Implementation:
    * Interactive Shell (cmd module): Use Python's cmd.Cmd subclass to create a command-line interface where the user can type commands like review_page <page_num>, correct_entity <page_id> <entity_id> <new_value>, merge_products <page_id> <prod_id1> <prod_id2>, skip_page, next_page, save_and_exit. 19
    * Visual Review Loop:
        * When review_page is called, the script will:
            * Load the corresponding page image from pdf_parser.py.
            * Overlay the extracted text tokens, their predicted LayoutLM labels, and inferred product/brand bounding boxes onto this image using Pillow's ImageDraw.
            * Save this annotated image to a temporary file (e.g., temp_review_page_X.png).
            * The controller.sh will then use OS commands (xdg-open, open, start) to automatically open this image in the user's default image viewer, providing immediate visual context.
            * Present a text-based summary of extracted entities for the current page in the terminal, prompting for corrections.
    * Guided Correction:
        * For entity corrections: Prompt for the correct text value.
        * For bounding box corrections: Allow the user to input new x0,y0,x1,y1 coordinates.
        * For grouping corrections: Allow users to manually merge or split product entries.
    * Learning Data Collection: Every user correction (original prediction, corrected value, page number, bounding box, type of correction) will be meticulously recorded and appended to data/learning_data/learning_data.json. This is the "ground truth" for model retraining. 21
    * Progress & Status: Display clear progress indicators (e.g., "Reviewing Page X of Y", "X corrections made so far").
2.5. brand_sourcing.py (The "Web Lookup" Block)
* Purpose: Automatically search for and source official brand URLs and high-quality brand logos.
* Parabola.io Inspiration: An "enrichment" block that pulls external data.
* Implementation:
    * Take unique brand names identified by layout_analyzer.py.
    * Use Playwright to perform targeted Google searches (e.g., "Brand Name" official website).
    * Extract the URLs and titles of the top few organic search results.
    * Interactive Validation: Present these options to the user via interactive_feedback.py for confirmation: "Which of these is the official website for?" Allow manual input if none are correct.
    * Use Playwright to attempt to download the brand logo from the confirmed URL. Implement logic to identify common logo elements (e.g., <img> tags in header, alt text containing brand name). 23
    * Save brand logos to data/images/brands/.
    * Store the confirmed URL and local image path with the brand data.
    * Use fuzzywuzzy for robust fuzzy string matching to compare extracted brand names with search results and ensure accurate association. 26
2.6. barcode_detector.py (The "Barcode Scan" Block)
* Purpose: Detect and decode barcodes from product images or page regions.
* Parabola.io Inspiration: A specialized "data transformation" block.
* Implementation:
    * For each product image or relevant page region (identified by LayoutLM):
        * Render the region to a Pixmap using PyMuPDF.
        * Convert the Pixmap to a NumPy array for OpenCV processing.
        * Apply image processing techniques (e.g., gradient analysis, morphological operations) using OpenCV to enhance barcode regions.
        * Use pyzbar to detect and decode barcodes.
    * Interactive Validation: In interactive_feedback.py, display the page image with detected barcode bounding boxes and decoded text. Ask for user confirmation or correction.
    * Store decoded barcode data with the corresponding product.
2.7. json_generator.py (The "Output" Block)
* Purpose: Consolidate all extracted, validated, and enriched data into the final JSON output.
* Parabola.io Inspiration: The final "Export Data" block.
* Implementation:
    * Gather all product and brand data from intermediate files and user-corrected data.
    * Collect all unique brand names and sort them alphabetically.
    * Assign a 1-based idx to each brand based on its alphabetical order.
    * Construct the final JSON structure:
        * Top-level catalogue_url key.
        * sorted_brands array (alphabetically ordered brand names).
        * brands_data dictionary, where each key is a brand name, and its value is an object containing idx, brand_image_path, brand_url, and an array of associated product objects.
        * Each product object includes page_number, sku, product_name, images (local paths), prices, variations, minimum_order_quantity, barcodes, related_products.
    * Save the output to output/2023-grower-catalog.json. 31
2.8. diff_learner.py (The "Comparison & Learning" Block)
* Purpose: Compare the script's output with a user-provided ground truth JSON and generate new learning data.
* Parabola.io Inspiration: A "Compare" block that highlights discrepancies and feeds into a learning loop.
* Implementation:
    * Take the generated 2023-grower-catalog.json and a user-provided "ground truth" JSON.
    * Use a JSON diffing library (jsondiff 33 or recursive-diff 34) to identify all differences (additions, deletions, modifications).
    * Present these differences to the user in a clear, human-readable format (e.g., "Difference on Page X, Product Y: Price changed from $10.00 to $12.50").
    * Prompt the user to confirm which differences represent corrective feedback that should be used for learning.
    * Convert confirmed corrections into new labeled data points (e.g., original text + bbox + corrected label) and append them to data/learning_data/learning_data.json. 21
2.9. learning_updater.py (The "Model Training" Block)
* Purpose: Use accumulated user feedback to fine-tune the LayoutLM model and refine post-processing heuristics.
* Parabola.io Inspiration: The "Train Model" block, showing continuous improvement.
* Implementation:
    * Read data/learning_data/learning_data.json.
    * LayoutLM Fine-tuning:
        * Convert user corrections into the BIO format required for LayoutLM fine-tuning.
        * Use the Hugging Face transformers library to fine-tune the LayoutLM model on this new dataset. This will be a potentially long-running process, with progress indicators.
        * Save the updated LayoutLM model weights.
    * Heuristic Refinement: Implement a mechanism to adjust post-processing heuristics (e.g., spatial grouping thresholds, font size rules) based on the type and frequency of user corrections. This could involve a simple rule-based update or a more sophisticated adaptive algorithm.
    * Update the state.json to reflect the new model version and heuristic configuration.
2.10. controller.sh (Enhanced Interactive Environment)
* Purpose: Provide the "Parabola.io-like" interactive experience.
* Implementation:
    * Main Menu: Present a clear menu of actions (e.g., start_new_catalog, resume_catalog, review_data, train_model, exit).
    * Guided Workflow: Each menu option triggers a sequence of Python script calls, with controller.sh managing the flow.
    * Conditional "Faucets": Use read -p for user input at decision points. Example: Bash     echo "--- PDF Parsing Complete ---"
    * echo "Extracted data from $TOTAL_PAGES pages."
    * read -p "Would you like to review the extracted data? (y/n): " review_choice
    * if [[ "$review_choice" == "y" ]]; then
    *     python interactive_feedback.py --mode review_pages
    * fi
    *     
    * Visual Cues: Use echo with ANSI escape codes for colors, bold text, and simple ASCII art to enhance readability and engagement.
    * Progress Bars/Indicators: Simple text-based progress bars for longer operations (e.g., [#####-----] 50%).
    * Error Handling: If a Python script exits with an error, controller.sh catches it, displays a user-friendly message, and suggests next steps (e.g., "An error occurred during barcode detection. Would you like to skip this step or try again?").
    * "Fun" Elements: Incorporate encouraging messages, playful prompts, and a sense of accomplishment as steps are completed. "Great job! You've just taught the AI something new!"
3. GitHub Project Considerations
* Clear README: A comprehensive README.md explaining the project, its inspiration, how to set it up, how to use it, and how the learning mechanism works.
* Contribution Guidelines: Encourage community contributions for new heuristics, model improvements, or UI enhancements.
* Example Catalog: Include a small sample PDF and a corresponding ground truth JSON for quick testing and demonstration.
* License: Choose an open-source license (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0).
* Screenshots/GIFs: Crucial for showcasing the interactive nature and "Parabola.io-like" feel.
This detailed plan aims to create a robust, intelligent, and genuinely user-friendly PDF extraction tool that makes the often tedious process of data extraction an engaging and continuously improving experience.
